# Password-Generator
I created a password generator.  This password generator is able to make the user create a random password using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers.  This generator also allows you to select the amount of characters that you use between 8-128.  

Directions:
-First, you select the "Generate Password" button
-Second, a prompt to select lowercase letters appears.  The user selects ok or cancel.
-Third, a prompt to select uppercase letters appears.
The user selects ok or cancel.
-Fourth,a prompt to select special characters appears.
The user selects ok or cancel.
-Fifth,a prompt to select numbers appears.
The user selects ok or cancel.
-Sixth, a prompt to select the amount of characters between 8-128.
The use selects their choice in the message bar.
-Finally, the screen will display the new generated password.
